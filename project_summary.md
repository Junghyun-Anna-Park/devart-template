## Authors

## Description
De-Code(www.de-code.cc) is creative media computing group at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST): Code is one of key initiative for Design. As theorizing in science and technology becomes more complex, interacting mechanisms is applied to possibly reactive input. The intuitive predictions derived from theories actually hold, but some researchers have questions whether the measure of what we love should be used at all. Such quantitative predictions remain an important aspect of who we are. So we decide to be what we love.
