## Description
De-Code(www.de-code.cc) is creative media computing group at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST): Code is one of key initiative for Design. As theorizing in science and technology becomes more complex, interacting mechanisms is applied to possibly reactive input. The intuitive predictions derived from theories actually hold, but some researchers have questions whether the measure of what we love should be used at all. Such quantitative predictions remain an important aspect of who we are. So we decide to be what we love.

De-Code, Creative media computing group at KAIST, had created a Kinect-powered interactive art installation for spring festival annually named FUNACT. The concept behind shows happy our school life through the interactive building projection. Such installation reads the studentâ€™s entire body, motion and gesture to match algorithmically generated skeleton. Students then get score (e.g., bad, good, and excellent) depend on match moving. The software that generated the FUNACT are used mainly: kinect and processing.
